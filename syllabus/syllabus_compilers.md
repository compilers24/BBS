**Student Learning Outcomes:**

The following chart shows alignment between course-specific and program student learning outcomes and program goals. [Note: in determining course-specific outcomes, it is important to review the curriculum map to relate the appropriate skill level if specified (e.g. beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Outcomes should be clear, attainable, and measurable.)

| Program Goal  | Program Student Learning Outcomes  | Course Learning Objectives  |
|---|---|---|
| To provide with knowledge and skills in design, development and management of efficient computing systems that solve real-life industrial and academic problems. | The students completing the course are expected to possess the following skills and abilities: | 1. Theory: Introduce the essential elements of programming language translations. |
| | | 2. Theory: Discuss the structure and concepts of modern programming languages. |
| | 2. Be able to assume different roles in a project, including leadership and management. | 3. Theory: Be acquainted with language & grammar theories. Be able to describe the language grammar in a dedicated notation. |
| | 3. Possess the skills of development of translators: | 4. Have understanding of compilation steps: lexical and syntax analysis. Creation of abstract syntax tree. Generating native code. Linkers and loaders. |
| 2. To nurture the professional values of teamwork,  integrity  and leadership. |  | 5. Programming: Learn to write recoursive-descent parser and code generator for an existing hardware |
| |  | 6. Tools: Have experience using compiler compiler tools to create autogenerated translators. |
| |  | |

**Method of Evaluation:**

Student learning will be evaluated on the basis of the following weighted components:

* Homework assignments and labs:  60% of final grade
* Grade of midterm examinations: 20%, 20%

**Make-up Procedures:**

Students are required to take tests, exams and quizzes when they are scheduled by the instructor. In the event that a student misses a test, exam or quiz, the instructor is under no obligation to give a make-up, unless the student brings convincing, objective evidence that it was impossible for the student to take it at the scheduled time due to a medical or other emergency. Students should give instructors written notice of any absences from tests, exams or quizzes BEFORE the test, exam or quiz. In the event of an unscheduled quiz, the student should have a good reason for absence. If there is no good reason for the absence, it is up to the instructor to decide how or whether to give a make-up exam or take into account the missing work when calculating the final grade.

**Library and Media/Technology Use**

To enhance their overall learning in the course, students are strongly encouraged to use supplemental online and reference materials available in the library.

**Policy on Grade Appeal**

Students are entitled to appeal grades in line with the university’s Grades Policies policy which is available online at [http://policies.aua.am](http://policies.aua.am)

**Standards for Academic Integrity**

Students are required to conduct themselves in an academically responsible and ethical manner in line with the Student Code of Ethics. Acts of academic dishonesty impair the academic integrity of AUA and create an unfair academic advantage for the student involved and other member(s) of the academic community. These acts are subject to disciplinary measures as prescribed in the AUA Code of Student Ethics [http://policies.aua.am/policy/10](http://policies.aua.am/policy/10)

The Student Code of Conduct can be found at [http://policies.aua.am/policy/101](http://policies.aua.am/policy/101)


**Special Needs:**
Students requiring special accommodations for learning should contact the Center for Student Success by the end of the Drop/Add period with such requests. studentsuccess@aua.am, [http://studentsuccess.aua.am/disability-support-services/](http://studentsuccess.aua.am/disability-support-services/)
